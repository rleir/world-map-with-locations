# world-map-with-locations

The Nature Museum makes acquisitions worldwide for its collections and to support research. This graphic shows the locations of acquisitons since 1993.

The zoomable world map is based on the leaflet.js library with map tiles from OpenStreetMap.

The icons show the locations of institutions. Click on a location to see a popup naming the partner organizations.

The data in GeoJSON format is prepared by the sibling project latlong-col.
